# Crud application

> author: thomas-laforge

### Run Application

```bash
npx nx serve angular-crud-application
```

### Documentation and Instruction

Challenge documentation is [here](https://angular-challenges.vercel.app/challenges/angular/5-crud/).

### Statement

In this exercise, you have a small CRUD application, which get a list of TODOS, update and delete some todos.

Currently, we have a working example but filled with lots of bad practices.

### Step 1: refactor with best practices

What you will need to do:

    Avoid any as a type. Using Interface to leverage Typescript type system prevent errors
    Use a separate service for all your http calls and use a Signal for your todoList
    Don’t mutate data

// Avoid this
this.todos[todoUpdated.id - 1] = todoUpdated;

// Prefer something like this, but need to be improved because we still want the same order
this.todos = [...this.todos.filter((t) => t.id !== todoUpdated.id), todoUpdated];

### Step 2: Improve

    Add a Delete button: Doc of fake API
    Handle errors correctly. (Globally)
    Add a Global loading indicator. You can use MatProgressSpinnerModule

### Step 3: Maintainability!! add some test

    Add 2/3 tests

### Step 4: Awesomeness!!! master your state.

    Use the component store of ngrx, ngrx/store, rxAngular, tanstack-query or ngrx/signal-store as a local state of your component.
    Have a localized Loading/Error indicator, e.g. only on the Todo being processed and disable all buttons of the processed Todo. (Hint: you will need to create an ItemComponent)
